# SQL Window Functions Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates advanced proficiency in **SQL window functions** through practical application on an employee dataset. Designed for seasoned **data analysts** and **SQL professionals**, the project highlights mastery of complex querying techniques essential for sophisticated **data analysis**, **business intelligence**, and **performance reporting**.

Key window functions utilized include `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()`, and cumulative `SUM()`, enabling nuanced **ranking**, **running totals**, and **sequential data comparisons** within grouped data partitions.

## Project Contents

- `employees.sql`: Script to create and populate the employee table with realistic sample data.
- `queries.sql`: Comprehensive set of window function queries demonstrating practical use cases.
- `README.md`: Detailed project description, instructions, and insights.

## Troubleshooting & Problem-Solving

During implementation, I encountered and resolved common challenges encountered in real-world database environments:

- **Database visibility and selection:** Initially, access to the database and tables was limited due to default UI settings. I identified and enabled the necessary options to reveal all databases and set the appropriate active schema, ensuring smooth query execution.
- **Schema referencing:** Errors caused by missing or incorrect schema qualifiers (`schema_name.table_name`) were addressed by clarifying the active database context and adjusting query references accordingly.
- **Git version control conflicts:** When pushing project files to GitHub, I resolved conflicts between local and remote repositories by performing merges with the `--allow-unrelated-histories` flag and carefully handling merge commits to maintain a clean and accurate project history.

These troubleshooting steps demonstrate strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and deep understanding of SQL environments and version control workflows.

## How to Use

1. Execute the `employees.sql` script on a **PostgreSQL** or compatible SQL platform to create and populate the dataset.
2. Run the `queries.sql` file to observe and analyze the outputs of various window functions applied to the data.
3. Modify or extend the queries to suit specific business analysis scenarios or to deepen exploration of advanced SQL concepts.

## Why This Project Matters

SQL window functions are indispensable in any advanced **data analyst** or **business intelligence** role because they enable:

- Granular aggregations and metrics without sacrificing row-level data
- Dynamic ranking and percentile calculations within partitions
- Running totals and trend analyses vital for time-series and cohort studies
- Sophisticated row comparisons for detailed sequential insights

Mastery of these functions equips professionals to deliver actionable insights across diverse industries including **finance**, **marketing**, **HR analytics**, and **operations**.
